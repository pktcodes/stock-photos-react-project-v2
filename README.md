# Stock Photos 🖼️
> PROD [Live] : https://react-stock-photos-v2-prod.netlify.app/

#### Stock Photos consists of a straightforward user interface where there is a
- List of random high-quality images from Unsplash API, by default the images shown are set to 10 and search value is set to cat.
- **Search form** to query for a specific category of images when filled it and press the **`Submit`** button or enter to submit.
- **`Loading...`** will be shown while fetching the images, **`There was an error`** if any error has occurred, and **`No Results Found`** when there are no matching results for the query.
- **Dark Mode** has been implemented where the user can switch between the themes using the **`Toggle`** button which changes the colors of the page accordingly and **Local storage** has been used to persist the preference of the theme when the user revisits the application.
- Styles are handled by `index.css`, data fetching and manipulation using **React Query** & **Axios**
- To run the project locally, clone the repo, `npm install` to install the dependencies, and `npm run dev` to start up the development server on default port 5173.
